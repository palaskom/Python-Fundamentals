>Always think about Recursion!!

```python
numbers = [2, 4, 4, 6, 25]

for number in numbers:
	print(number * number)

print(number) # number = 25 - not limited in scope of for-loop
```

```python
for index, errand in enumerate(errands):
	print(f"{index + 1}. {errand}")

# equivalent
for index, errand in enumerate(errands, 1):
	print(f"{index}. {errand}")
```
```python
# print from 1 to 10 in steps of 2
for number in range(1, 11, 2):
	print(number)
```
