## Definition
A mutable, unordered data structure that prohibits duplicate values.
A set can contain only immutable objects (e.g., cannot contain a list, but it can contain a tuple).

Since it is an unordered data structure, they do not support indexing. But they support iteration (they can be traversed). But set elements may not be traversed in the order they appear to be:
```python
lottery_numbers = {(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)}
for numbers in lottery_numbers:
	for number in numbers:
		print(number)

# output: 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The only way to create an empty set is as follows:
```python
emtpy_set = set()
```
## Comprehension

Since elements must be unique, duplicate elements are removed. In the following example, the negative numbers yield the same square as the positive ones, thus they are removed.

```python
squares = {number ** 2 for number in range(-5, 6)}

print(squares)
```

## Set Related Funtions
We'll use the following sets for our examples
```python
candy_bars = {"KitKat", "Twix", "Mars", "KitKat", "Snickers"}
sweet_things = {"KitKat", "Snickers", "Milky Way", "Twix", "100 Grand"}
```

### Intersection
```python
# both print the same result
print(candy_bars.intersection(sweet_things))
print(candy_bars & sweet_things)
```

### Union
```python
# both print the same result
print(candy_bars.union(sweet_things))
print(candy_bars | sweet_things)
```

### Difference
```python
# A-B
print(candy_bars.difference(sweet_things))
print(candy_bars - sweet_things)

# B-A
print(sweet_things.difference(candy_bars))
print(sweet_things - candy_bars)
```

### Symmetric Difference
```python
# Union - Intersection
print(candy_bars.symmetric_difference(sweet_things))
print(candy_bars ^ sweet_things)
```

### Subset / Superset
```python
a = {1, 2, 4}
b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(a.issubset(b))
print(a < b)
print(a <= b)

print(a.issuperset(b))
print(a > b)
print(a >= b)
```

## Immutable Sets
There is a type of set called "frozenset" that is immutable

```python
mr_freeze = frozenset(["spam", "eggs", "spam"])
print(mr_freeze)
print(type(mr_freeze))

# mr_freeze.add("bacon") # raises AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'

# regulat_set = {1, 3, 4}
# print(regular_set: "Some value") # A regular set cannot be used as a key as it is mutable

print({mr_freeze: "Some value"})
```
