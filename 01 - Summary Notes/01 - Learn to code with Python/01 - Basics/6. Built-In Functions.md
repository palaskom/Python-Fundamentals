## Help

```python
help(len)
help(print)
help(max)
help(str)
help(int)
help(list)
help("hello".replace)
help("hello".split)
help([1].extend)
```

## Dir

Returns all methods associated with the object in question
```python
print(dir([])) # prints all available methods of the list object
print(dir("pasta")) # prints all available methods of the string object
```

We can observe many methods with double underscores. The are called "dunder" methods ("d" from "double and "under" from "underscores"). They are meant to be used only Python internally, although they are accessible by us.

```python
print(len("pasta"))
print("pasta".__len__())
```

When calling len(), Python internally invokes dunder len. 

Another Example:
```python
print("st" in "pasta")
print("pasta".__contains__("st"))
```

## Format

It returns strings from numbers in a more aesthetic format

```python
number = 0.123456789
print(type(format(number, ".2f"))) # format returns a string
print(format(number, ".2f")) # prints the number with two decimal places
```

```python
print(format(0.5, ".2%")). # return 50.00%
```

```python
print(format(13253959, ",")) # returns 13,253,959
```
