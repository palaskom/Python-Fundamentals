## Definitions

### OOP
Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm for code organization and design that view a software program as a collection of objects that interact with each other.
### Object
An object is a container of data and behavior
### Atributes
Attributes define an object's state or internal data. Attributes can be viewed as variables belonging to an object.
### Method
A method can be viewed as a function belonging to an object. A method is a command or instruction or a message to send to an object. A method can interact with and modify the object's attributes, thus altering its state.
### Class
A class is a blueprint for defining a new object type in Python. A class definition describes the attributes and methods each object made from the class will have.
### Instance
An instance is an object created from the class. The act of creating an instance is called instantiation. Objects created from the same class are independent of each other.

## Class Example
```python
class Book():

def __init__(self, title, author, price=14.99):
	self.title = title
	self.author = author
	self.price = price

animal_farm = Book("Animal Farm", "George Orwell")
gatsby = Book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 19.99)
atlas = Book(author="John Muir", title="Atlas Shrugged", price=12.99)

print(animal_farm.title)
print(gatsby.price)
```

## Docstring
A **docstring** is a string placed at the top of a module, function, class or method that serves as its documentation. Documentation for any object can accessed by passing it to the **help** function. The Python library ecosystem also includes tools to parse docstrings into professional documentation (such as HTML pages).
```python
"""
A module related to the joy of sushi.
No fishy code found here!
"""

def fish():
	"""
	Determines if the fish is good meal choice.
	Always returns True, because it always is.
	"""
	return True

class Salmon():
	"""
	Blueprint for a Salmon object.
	"""
	def __init__(self):
		self.tastiness = 10

	def bake(self):
		"""
		Bake the fish in the oven.
		"""
```
Using the help() function either on a module or a class method or a function, we can retrieve the necessary details
```python
import sushi  # the file above
import math

# print(sushi.__doc__)
# print(sushi.fish.__doc__)
# print(sushi.Salmon.__doc__)
# print(sushi.Salmon.bake.__doc__)
# print(math.__doc__)
# print(math.sqrt.__doc__)

help(sushi)
```
## Namedtuple
This is like structs in other programming languages. It is like a class with only attributes, no methods:
```python
import collections

Book = collections.namedtuple("Book", ["title", "author"])

animal_farm = Book("Animal Farm", "George Orwell")
gatsby = Book(title="The Great Gatsby", author="F. Scott Fitzgerald")

print(animal_farm[0])
print(animal_farm.title)

print(gatsby[1])
print(gatsby.author)
```
