# Definitions
## Inheritance
It is a design pattern in which a class inherits (or receives) attributes and methods from one or more other classes.
Inheritance helps to organize related class and reduce duplication

The class being inherited is called the parent, or subclass, or base class. The class the inherits is called the child, subclass or derived class.

Public and protected (beginning with single underscore) are inherited by the subclass
Private, name mangled attributes beginning with double underscores are not inherited by the subclass.

## Super Method
```python
class Animal():
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
	
	def eat(self, food):
		return f"{self.name} is enjoying the {food}"

  
class Dog(Animal):
	def __init__(self, name, breed):	
		super().__init__(name)
		self.breed = breed

  
watson = Dog("Watson", "Golden Retriever")
print(watson.name)
print(watson.eat("bacon"))
```

## Polymorphism
Multiple objects can react to the same method invocation
### Example 1
```python
class Person():
	def __init__(self, name, height):
		self.name = name
		self.height = height
	
	def __len__(self):
		return self.height


values = [
	"Boris",
	[1, 2, 3],
	(4, 5, 6, 7),
	{"a": 1, "b": 2},
	Person(name="Boris", height=71)
]

for value in values:
	print(len(value)) # <object>.__len__()
```
### Example 2
```python
import random

class Player():
	def __init__(self, games_played, victories):
		self.games_played = games_played
		self.victories = victories
	
	@property
	def win_ratio(self):
		return self.victories / self.games_played


class HumanPlayer(Player):
	def make_move(self):
		print("Let player make the decision!")


class ComputerPlayer(Player):
	def make_move(self):
		print("Run advanced algorithm to calculate best move!")

  
hp = HumanPlayer(games_played=30, victories=15)
cp = ComputerPlayer(games_played=1000, victories=999)

print(hp.win_ratio)
print(cp.win_ratio)

game_players = [hp, cp]
starting_player = random.choice(game_players)
starting_player.make_move()
```

## Name mangling
Attributes starting with double underscore are used for privacy. Python makes it difficult to access them so that we don't override them. They are usually used in superclasses so the we don't override them when we implement subclasses.
```python
class Nonsense():
	def __init__(self):
		self.__some_attribute = "Hello"
	
	def __some_method(self):
		print("This is coming from some_method!")

  
class SpecialNonsense(Nonsense):
	pass

  
n = Nonsense()
sn = SpecialNonsense()
# print(n.__some_attribute) # not accessible
# print(sn.__some_attribute) # not accessible
# n.__some_method() # not accessible
# sn.__some_method() # not accessible
print(n._Nonsense__some_attribute)
print(sn._Nonsense__some_attribute)
n._Nonsense__some_method()
sn._Nonsense__some_method()
```

## Multiple Inheritance

### Example 1

```python
class FrozenFood():
	def thaw(self, minutes):
		print(f"Thawing for {minutes} minutes")
	
	def store(self):
		print("Putting in the freezer!")
  
	class Dessert():
		def add_weight(self):
			print("Putting on the pounds!")
	
	def store(self):
		print("Putting in the refrigerator!")
	
	
class IceCream(FrozenFood, Dessert):
	pass

  
ic = IceCream()
ic.add_weight()
ic.thaw(5)
ic.store() # prints from FrozenFood because it is closer to the IceCream class
print(IceCream.mro()) # Method Resolution Order (IceCream -> FrozenFood -> Dessert)
```
### Example 2
```python
class Restaurant():
	def make_reservation(self, party_size):
		print(f"Booked a table for {party_size}")

  
class Steakhouse(Restaurant):
	pass


class Bar():
	def make_reservation(self, party_size):
		print(f"Booked a lounge for {party_size}")

  
class BarAndGrill(Steakhouse, Bar):
	pass

  
bag = BarAndGrill()
bag.make_reservation(2) # depth-first search
print(BarAndGrill.mro()) # BarAndGrill -> Steakhouse -> Restaurant -> Bar
```
### Example 3
The **diamond inheritance** problem occurs when the same superclass is referenced multiple times in the inheritance hierarchy of a class. This happens when a class inherits from two classes that **both** inherit from the same class. In these scenarios, Python will remove the first occurrence of all duplicate superclasses from the search.
```python
class FilmMaker():
	def give_interview(self):
		print("I love making movies")

  
class Director(FilmMaker):
	pass


class Screenwriter(FilmMaker):
	def give_interview(self):
		print("I love writing scripts")

  
class JackOffAllTrades(Director, Screenwriter):
	pass

  
stallone = JackOffAllTrades()
stallone.give_interview()
print(JackOffAllTrades.mro()) # JackOffAllTrades -> Director -> Screenwriter -> FilmMaker
```
## Isinstance and Issubclass
```python
print(isinstance(1, int))
print(isinstance({"a": 1}, dict))
print(isinstance([], list))
print(isinstance([], int))

print(isinstance(1, object))
print(isinstance(max, object))

print(isinstance([], (list, dict, int)))

class Person():
	pass

class Superhero(Person):
	pass

  
arnold = Person()
boris = Superhero()

print(isinstance(boris, Superhero))
print(isinstance(boris, Person))
print(isinstance(arnold, Superhero))
print(issubclass(Superhero, Person))
print(issubclass(Person, Superhero))
print(issubclass(Superhero, object))
print(issubclass(Person, object))
```

## Composition
**Composition** is a design principle in object-oriented programming where one class contains an instance of another class as a part of its attributes, allowing objects to be built using other objects. It represents a “has-a” relationship, as opposed to inheritance, which represents an “is-a” relationship.
```python
class Paper():
	def __init__(self, text, case):
		self.text = text
		self.case = case

  
class Briefcase():
	def __init__(self, price):
		self.price = price
		self.papers = []
  
	def add_paper(self, paper):
		self.papers.append(paper)

	def view_notes(self):	
		return [paper.text for paper in self.papers]
  
  
class Lawyer():
	def __init__(self, name, briefcase):
		self.name = name
		self.briefcase = briefcase

	def write_note(self, text, case):
		paper = Paper(text, case)
		self.briefcase.add_paper(paper)

	def view_notes(self):	
		print(self.briefcase.view_notes())

  
cheap_briefcase = Briefcase(price=19.99)
vinny = Lawyer(name="Vincent", briefcase=cheap_briefcase)
vinny.write_note("My client is innocent!", "AS-2ZK1")
vinny.write_note("There is no evident of a crime!", "AS-2ZK1")
vinny.view_notes()
```
