## Hook
A procedure that intercepts a process at some point of execution. A magic method is a hook, a method called by Python behind the scenes at the right moment.
Python includes several **magic** **methods**, also called **special methods**, that you can define in your classes. These methods begin and end with double underscores (`​__`​) and developers like to call them **dunder** methods. ​A **magic method** is called implicitly by Python behind the scenes. They can be used to make our custom objects play friendly with existing Python functionalities like iteration, indexing, length, truthiness and more.
```python
print(3.3 + 4.4)
print(3.3.__add__(4.4)) # called by Python

print(len([1, 3, 5]))
print([1, 2, 3].__len__()) # called by Python

print("h" in "hello")
print("hello".__contains__("h")) # called by Python

print(["a", "b", "c"][2])
print(["a", "b", "c"].__getitem__(2)) # called by Python
```
## Class Representation
- __ str __ : used for "friendly representation". If the __ str __ is not overridden, Python calls the the  __ repr __
- __ repr __ : used for a more technical representation, (e.g., how an object of the class is created)

```python
class Card():
	def __init__(self, rank, suit):
		self.rank = rank
		self.suit = suit
	
	def __str__(self):
		return f"{self.rank} of {self.suit}"
	
	def __repr__(self):
		return f'Card("{self.rank}", "{self.suit}")'


c = Card("Ace", "Spades")
print(c) # or print(str(c)) -> c.__str__()
print(repr(c)) # -> c.__repr__()
```
## Comparison & Math Operations
The implementation of each magic method is up to us:
```python
class Student():
	def __init__(self, math, history, writing):
		self.math = math
		self.history = history
		self.writing = writing
	
	@property
	def grades(self):
		return self.math + self.history + self.writing
	
	def __eq__(self, other_student):
		return self.grades == other_student.grades
	
	def __gt__(self, other_student):
		return self.grades > other_student.grades
	
	def __le__(self, other_student):
		return self.grades <= other_student.grades
	
	def __add__(self, other_students):
		return self.grades + other_students.grades
	
	def __sub__(self, other_student):
		return self.grades - other_student.grades


bob = Student(math=90, history=90, writing=90) # 270
moe = Student(math=100, history=90, writing=80) # 270
joe = Student(math=40, history=45, writing=50)

print(bob.grades)
print(moe.grades)

print(bob == moe) # bob.__eq__(moe) => True
print(moe != joe) # => True
print(moe > joe)
print(joe <= bob)
print(bob + moe)
print(moe - joe)
```
## Truthiness & Falsiness
```python
class Emotion():
	def __init__(self, positivity, negativity):
		self.positivity = positivity
		self.negativity = negativity
	
	def __bool__(self):
		return self.positivity > self.negativity


my_emotional_state = Emotion(positivity=50, negativity=75)

if my_emotional_state:
	print("This will NOT print because I have " +
		  "I more negativity that positivity")

my_emotional_state.positivity = 100

if my_emotional_state:
	print("This WILL print because I have " +
		  "more positivity than negativity")
```
## Length
```python
import collections

Book = collections.namedtuple("Book", ["title", "author"])
animal_farm = Book("Animal Farm", "George Orwell")
gatsby = Book(title="The Great Gatsby", author="F. Scott Fitzgerald")

  
class Library():
	def __init__(self, *books):
		self.books = books
		self.librarians = []
	
	def __len__(self):
		return len(self.books)


l1 = Library(animal_farm)
l2 = Library(animal_farm, gatsby)
print(len(l1))
print(len(l2))
```

## Indexing & Iteration
```python
pillows = {
	"soft": 79.99,
	"hard": 99.99
}

print(pillows["soft"])
print(pillows.__getitem__("soft"))


class CrayonBox():
	def __init__(self):
		self.crayons = []
	
	def add(self, crayon):
		self.crayons.append(crayon)
	
	def __getitem__(self, index):
		return self.crayons[index]
	
	def __setitem__(self, index, value):
		self.crayons[index] = value

  
cb = CrayonBox()
cb.add("Blue")
cb.add("Red")
print(cb[1]) # prints -> Red

cb[0] = "Yellow"
print(cb[0])

for crayon in cb:
	print(crayon)
```

## Delete
It is called when the object is not reference and is garbage collected. It is usually used for cleanup operation before an object of our class is deleted (e.g., close database connection, delete a file we created etc.)
```python
import time

class Garbage():
	def __del__(self):
		print("This is my last breath!")

g = Garbage()

g = [1, 2, 3]

time.sleep(5)

print("Program done!")
```
After g is assigned to the new list, the message "This is my last breath!" is printed to the console since there is no reference to the Garbage object.
